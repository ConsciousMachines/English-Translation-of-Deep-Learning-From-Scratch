This is a translation of the best books ever written, called the [Deep Learning From Scrach](https://koki0702.github.io/dezero-book/en/index.html) series. I already did the translation using Google Translate API. You can use the patch files I made to translate your own copy, by updating the path of your .EPUB file:

```Python
book_path          = r'/path/to/books/DL1.epub'
patch_file_path    = r'DL1_patch.txt'
patch_book(book_path, patch_file_path)
```
